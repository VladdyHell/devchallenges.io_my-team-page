I used advanced CSS properties, layout systems such as text orientation, grid system, relative unit 'REM', and media queries. I also used a browser extension for measuring pixel dimensions so that it makes it faster to specify without eye-ing because I'm so bad at eye-ing. And I also used semantical elements.
